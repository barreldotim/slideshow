2. Open up your Sketch file and select the Page that contains all the artboards to be exported
3. Go to *Plugins -> Slideshow
4. Select the Artboard layer alignment
4. Choose the folder where to export the .slideshow file
5. Voilà!

### Convertion
1. [Visit Barrel](http://barrel.im/slideshow?ref=github) and upload the exported .slideshow file
2. Download the pptx file once the convertion is done

## Important Guidelines
Slideshow is not perfect _yet_, so to get the best result, there are some things to remember while creating you presentation design file:

### 👉 Images and icons
Slideshow will automatically export images, but you need to individually mark them as **Exportable**. It is always recommened to mark svg icons as **Exportable**
